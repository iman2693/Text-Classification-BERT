# Text-Classification-BERT
Text Classification using BERT on a Persian dataset called Persica

## Overview

Welcome to the Text Classification project repository! This project focuses on utilizing ParsBert, a Persian language model, and Multilingual BERT for text classification tasks. The repository contains code, notebooks, and resources to understand, implement, and evaluate the performance of these models on text classification tasks.

## Repository Structure

- **Google Colab Links.txt**: This file provides convenient access to the Google Colab notebooks for running the code.

### Notebooks

- **Test1 - ParsBert.ipynb**: Initial text classification test using ParsBert.
- **Test2 - Without Preprocess - ParsBert.ipynb**: Text classification with ParsBert without preprocessing the data.
- **Test3_ParsBert - max size 256.ipynb**: Text classification using ParsBert with a maximum token size of 256.
- **Test4_Parsbert_256_weightdecay_0_1.ipynb**: Text classification with ParsBert, maximum token size 256, and weight decay set to 0.1.
- **Test5 - Multilingual Bert - 256.ipynb**: Text classification using Multilingual BERT with a maximum token size of 256.

### Data and Resources

- **persica.csv**: Dataset used for training and testing the text classification models.
- **stop.txt**: Stopwords file used for data preprocessing.

### Reports and Visualizations

- **Report.pdf**: A comprehensive report summarizing the experiments, results, and insights.
- **TextClassification.png**: Visualization related to text classification results.

## Usage

1. Use the Google Colab links in "Google Colab Links.txt" to access and run the notebooks.
2. Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed.
3. Explore, modify, and extend the code based on your specific text classification requirements.
